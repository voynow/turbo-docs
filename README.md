## Installation 🛠️

Before you can start using Turbo Docs, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Turbo Docs is compatible with Python 3.6 and above.

You can install the latest release version from pypi:

```bash
pip install turbo-docs
```

Install it directly for GitHub (not recommended) but sometimes useful:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/voynow/turbo-docs.git"
```

Or clone the repository for local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/voynow/turbo-docs.git
poetry install --all-extras
```

## Usage ⚙️

Turbo Docs is designed with a simple command-line interface, making it a breeze to generate your README or copy documentation to your clipboard.

### Commands

- **Generate README:**
  To generate a `README.md` file, navigate to your project directory and run:
  ```bash
  turbo_docs --readme
  ```
  This command will generate a `README.md` file based on the contents of your current directory, excluding files specified in the `.gitignore`.

- **Copy to Clipboard:**
  If you want to copy the contents of your current directory's documentation to the clipboard, use:
  ```bash
  turbo_docs --copy
  ```
  The text will be copied to the clipboard, and the number of tokens in the text will be displayed.

## Features ✨

- Markdown generation for `README.md` powered by OpenAI's language models
- Clipboard support for easy text manipulation
- Exclusion patterns to prevent certain files from being included in the documentation (supports `.gitignore` patterns)
- Command-line interface for straightforward usage

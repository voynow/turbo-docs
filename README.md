## Features

‚ú® **Automatic README Generation**: Run `turbo_docs --readme` to generate a `README.md` that reflects the entire repository content while excluding patterns listed in `.gitignore` and `pyproject.toml`.

‚úÇÔ∏è **Clipboard Ready**: Use `turbo_docs --copy` for copying all the relevant repository text into your clipboard, perfect for pasting into any AI or text manipulation service.

üîç **Token Counter**: Count the number of tokens in a directory's text, giving you insights into how concise or detailed your documentation might be.

## Installation and Usage

Before you can use Turbo Docs, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Also, you will need to install some dependencies.

Install the turbo_docs package using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install turbo_docs
    ```

To get started with Turbo Docs, navigate to your desired project directory and execute the commands:

**Generate README:**
```bash
turbo_docs --readme
```
_This will create or overwrite the existing `README.md` in the project directory._

**Copy Text To Clipboard:**
```bash
turbo_docs --copy
```
_This will copy the combined text content of the project directory (excluding ignored files and directories) onto your system's clipboard._

## Configuration

To adjust which files are ignored when generating documentation or copying text, Turbo Docs reads the `pyproject.toml`. If no configuration exists, Turbo Docs will create a default one with common patterns like `__pycache__`, `venv`, etc.

You may edit the `pyproject.toml` under `tool.turbo_docs.ignore` to suit your needs.
